\title{Run default erccdashboard analysis of ERCC control ratio mixtures}
\usage{
runDashboard(datType = NULL, isNorm = FALSE, exTable = NULL,
  repNormFactor = NULL, filenameRoot = NULL, sample1Name = NULL,
  sample2Name = NULL, erccmix = "RatioPair", erccdilution = 1,
  spikeVol = 1, totalRNAmass = 1, choseFDR = 0.05, ratioLim = c(-4, 4),
  signalLim = c(-14, 14), userMixFile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{datType}{type is "count" (RNA-Seq) or "array" (microarray),
"count" is unnormalized integer count data (normalized
RNA-Seq data will be accepted in an updated version of
the package), "array" can be normalized or unnormalized
fluorescent intensities from a microarray experiment.}

\item{isNorm}{default is FALSE, if FALSE then the unnormalized
input data will be
normalized in erccdashboard analysis. If TRUE then
it is expected that the data is already normalized}

\item{exTable}{data frame, the first column contains names of
genes or transcripts (Feature) and the remaining columns
are expression measures for sample replicates spiked
with ERCC controls}

\item{repNormFactor}{optional vector of normalization factors for each
replicate, default value is NULL and 75th percentile
normalization will be applied to replicates}

\item{filenameRoot}{string root name for output files}

\item{sample1Name}{string name for sample 1 in the gene expression
experiment}

\item{sample2Name}{string name for sample 2 in the gene expression
experiment}

\item{erccmix}{Name of ERCC mixture design, "RatioPair" is
default, the other option is "Single"}

\item{erccdilution}{unitless dilution factor used in dilution of the Ambion
ERCC spike-in mixture solutions}

\item{spikeVol}{volume in microliters of diluted ERCC mix spiked into
the total RNA samples}

\item{totalRNAmass}{mass in micrograms of total RNA spiked with diluted ERCC
mixtures}

\item{choseFDR}{False Discovery Rate for differential expression testing}

\item{ratioLim}{Limits for ratio axis on MA plot, default is c(-4,4)}

\item{signalLim}{Limits for ratio axis on MA plot, default is c(-14,14)}

\item{userMixFile}{optional filename input, default is NULL, if ERCC
                     control ratio mixtures other than the Ambion product
                     were used then a userMixFile can be used for the analysis}
