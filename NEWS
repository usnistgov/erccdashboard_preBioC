erccdashboard 0.99.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Fixed bug in erccROC and estLODR code to only use P-values from ERCCs by coding 
"ERCC-00" prefix instead of "ERCC-" which in some cases might find endogenous
transcripts named with this prefix.

REMOVED FUNCTIONALITY

ISSUES

* CMD check still takes too long (> 5 minutes), probably due to differential 
expression testing in underlying package. This will be difficult to change.
